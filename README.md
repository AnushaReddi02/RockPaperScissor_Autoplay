## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **HTML5** → for structuring the page and game UI.  
- **CSS3** → for styling buttons, results, and creating a clean dark theme.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** → for all the game logic:
  - Handling player input (rock, paper, scissors).  
  - Generating computer moves using `Math.random()`.  
  - Comparing moves and deciding the winner.  
  - Updating the DOM dynamically (`innerHTML`).  
  - Implementing **Auto Play** with `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`.  
  - Saving game state with **Local Storage (JSON.stringify & JSON.parse)**.
